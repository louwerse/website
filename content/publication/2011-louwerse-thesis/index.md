abstract = "Do  political  parties  fulfil  their  election  mandates?  This  study  provides an empirical analysis of a question many people feel they already have an answer to. The extent to which parties talk about similar issues and take similar positions before  and  after  elections  is  studied  in  the  context  of  the  United  Kingdom and the Netherlands. The main question is whether the different institutional structures in these countries lead to differences in  mandate fulfilment. To  answer  this  question,  this  book  provides  an  analysis  of  parties' election manifestos and parliamentary debates. It shows how the political competition changes  after  elections.  It  analyses  differences  between  government  and  opposition  and  the  impact  of  issue  saliency  and  policy  position  extremism.  Moreover, it provides an overview of mandate fulfilment since the 1950s: has party mandate fulfilment declined?"

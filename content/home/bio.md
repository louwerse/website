I am an [Assistant Professor in Political Science](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/tom-louwerse) at Leiden University, the Netherlands. My main areas of interest include political representation, parliaments, political parties, elections, polls and voting advice applications.

### Career
I studied political science at Leiden University, obtaining my Master's degree (cum laude) in 2006 and my PhD in 2011. Part of my PhD research was completed at the University of Nottingham, where I was a guest PhD researcher in 2008. My PhD thesis, written under supervision of Prof. Rudy Andeweg and Dr Huib Pellikaan deals with the the democratic mandate of political parties in Great Britain and the Netherlands. This dissertation was shortlisted for the ECPR Jean Blondel Prize.

After I completed my dissertation, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Political Legitimacy](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research-focus-areas/political-legitimacy) research profile area at Leiden, a multi-disciplinary project involving history, law, political science and public administration. In addition, I taught at the Institute of Political Science.

From September 2013 to December 2015 I held the position of Assistant Professor in Political Science at [Trinity College Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/), Ireland. My responsibilities included teaching courses in research methods and statistics as well as comparative politics. I was Director of the M.Sc. in Politics & Public Policy in 2014-2015.

### Current role
In January 2016 I took up the position of Assistant Professor (Universitair Docent) of Political Science at Leiden University. Currently, I am teaching statistics to undergraduate students and a thesis seminar project for postgraduates.

I fulfil various professional service roles. I am Convenor of the [Standing Group on Parliaments](http://standinggroups.ecpr.eu/parliaments/), one of the largest and most active specialist groups within the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR). In the [V-Dem Project](https://www.v-dem.net/en/), I act as [Regional Manager](https://www.v-dem.net/en/team/regional-managers/) for Western Europe. In addition, I co-organized the Dutch Flemish Political Science conference [*Politicologenetmaal*](http://politicologenetmaal.eu/) with Hans Vollaard, Corinna Jentzsch and Nicolas Blarel in Leiden in 2017 and 2018.

My outreach activities include polling aggregation in the [Netherlands](http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/), published by the public broadcaster NOS, and [Ireland](http://www.pollingindicator.com/). I am a co-founder of and contributor to the Dutch political science weblog [Stuk Rood Vlees](http://www.stukroodvlees.nl/).

In September 2015 I received the [Emerging Scholars Award](http://www.apsanet.org/section-5-Emerging-Scholars-Award) from the Organized Section on Political Organizations and Parties of the American Political Science Association.

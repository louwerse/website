I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/tom-louwerse), the Netherlands. My [research](#projects) and [teaching](#teaching) focuses on elections, political representation and parliamentary politics in the Netherlands and other established democracies. 

<!-- My current research projects, supported by an Open Research Area (ORA) and NWO Vidi grant, focus on dyadic political representation and government-opposition cooperation in parliament. -->

My outreach activities include [Peilingwijzer](http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl), a poll aggregation project in collaboration with the the Dutch public broadcaster NOS. I am a contributor to the Dutch political science weblog [Stuk Rood Vlees](http://www.stukroodvlees.nl).

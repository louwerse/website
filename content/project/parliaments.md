The digital publication of parliamentary data has provided a great incentive for the study of parliamentary behaviour. My current work focuses mainly on the Netherlands, but also Belgium and Sweden as well as country-comparative analysis.

The main questions that I focus on are those of patterns of parliamentary (voting) behaviour, particularly with regard to party unity and the government-opposition division in parliament. In addition, I am interested in the concept of (positive and negative) parliamentarism as well as the government formation process.

### Current (working and conference) papers

Louwerse, T. (2015) The concept of 'positive' and 'negative' parliamentarism. Paper presented at the workshop 'Vague concepts and poor operationalization â€“ solutions to measurement problems in studies of government formation', Stockholm, 16-18 September.

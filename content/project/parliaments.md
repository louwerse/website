The digital publication of parliamentary data has provided a great incentive for the study of parliamentary behaviour. My current work focuses mainly on the Netherlands, but also Belgium and Sweden as well as country-comparative analysis.

The main questions that I focus on are those of patterns of parliamentary (voting) behaviour, particularly with regard to party unity and the government-opposition division in parliament. In addition, I am interested in the concept of (positive and negative) parliamentarism as well as the government formation process.

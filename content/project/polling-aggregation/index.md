Opinion polls are an increasingly central part of election campaigns. My work focuses on the aggregation of opinion polls in Ireland and the Netherlands.

## Peilingwijzer 
The Dutch public broadcaster NOS [publishes](http://www.peilingwijzer.nl) my aggregation of Dutch national opinion polls, called ['Peilingwijzer' (Polling Indicator)](http://peilingwijzer.tomlouwerse.nl/). 

## Irish Polling Indicator
My [Irish Polling Indicator](http://www.pollingindicator.com/) is published regularly on politicalreform.ie.
